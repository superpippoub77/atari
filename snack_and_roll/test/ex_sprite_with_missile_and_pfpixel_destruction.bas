   ;  Sprite With Missile and pfpixel Destruction
   ;
   ;  Example program by Duane Alan Hahn (Random Terrain) using
   ;  hints, tips, code snippets, and more from AtariAge members
   ;  such as batari, SeaGtGruff, RevEng, Robert M, Nukey Shay,
   ;  Atarius Maximus, jrok, supercat, GroovyBee, and bogax.
   ;
   ;```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
   ;
   ;  Instructions:
   ;  
   ;  Use the joystick to move the sprite. Press the fire button
   ;  to shoot the missile.
   ;

   ;  Variable aliases go here (DIMs).
   ;
   ;  You can have more than one alias for each variable.
   ;  If you use different aliases for bit operations,
   ;  it's easier to understand and remember what they do.
   ;
   ;  I start variable aliases with one underscore so I won't
   ;  have to worry that I might be using bB keywords by mistake.
   ;  I also start labels with two underscores for the same
   ;  reason. The second underscore also makes labels stand out 
   ;  so I can tell at a glance that they are labels and not
   ;  variables.
   ;
   ;  Use bit operations any time you need a simple off/on
   ;  variable. One variable essentially becomes 8 smaller
   ;  variables when you use bit operations.
   ;
   ;  I start my bit aliases with "_Bit" then follow that
   ;  with the bit number from 0 to 7, then another underscore
   ;  and the name. Example: _Bit0_Reset_Restrainer 
   ;
